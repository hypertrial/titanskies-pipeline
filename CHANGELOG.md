# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-18

This is the first public release. Releases and repository history before
0.3.1 remain private and unavailable.

### Added

- Added canonical source/licence and geography matrices, NASA TEMPO V02
  citation/DOI provenance, privacy terms, DCO sign-off, research-only and
  no-health/exposure/regulatory-advice notices, and no-endorsement language.
- Added repository-policy checks for geography-matrix completeness, synthetic
  fixtures, and forbidden tracked artifacts.

### Changed

- Consolidated GitHub Actions into one offline runner capped at five minutes
  total. Full 100%-coverage, Dagster/dbt, browser, data-quality, Costguard,
  geography, and live NetCDF validation remain local release gates.

### Removed

- Removed GitHub-hosted live readiness so Earthdata downloads and production
  geography builds run only on operator-owned machines.
- Removed the nonessential copied `.cursor/rules/ponytail.mdc` material.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- Task-oriented contributor and operator documentation, local browser
  rendering checks, GitHub issue/PR templates, CODEOWNERS, and constrained
  Dependabot updates
- Immutable geography generations behind one atomically replaced manifest,
  with deterministic build IDs, checksums, artifact modes, and rollback-safe
  retention
- Exact pooled region-hour statistics across all validated scans, monotonic raw
  hour revisions, sibling restoration, and checksum verification
- Incremental regional/anomaly dbt publication, including 28-day forward
  anomaly propagation and contract-version invalidation
- v0.2 to v0.3 clean-rebuild guide and production-geography live readiness

### Changed

- Constrained `dbt-core` below 1.12 and excluded incompatible 1.12+ updates from
  Dependabot until stable `dagster-dbt` releases support that boundary
- Prevented Dependabot from treating `netCDF4` 1.7.4 as universal while uv
  retains the compatible 1.7.3 split for Python 3.10 on Windows ARM64
- Warehouse and package schema version is now 0.3.0; populated v0.1/v0.2
  warehouses fail early with rebuild guidance
- CMR discovery now preserves nullable acquisition/revision metadata and uses
  one Arrow-backed merge without resetting processed state
- `tempo_no2_hourly_pipeline_schedule` now runs one discovery, pending
  processing, and incremental dbt publication through the full pipeline
- Environmental `zero_valid`, `low_coverage`, and `stale` findings remain
  visible but are advisory; integrity tests remain build blockers
- Live ingestion rejects synthetic geography and non-native production grids

### Fixed

- Public CMR discovery no longer requires Earthdata credentials; authentication
  remains mandatory when downloading granules.
- Dagster dbt runs fully release adapter connections so post-build live
  warehouse validation can reconnect safely.
- The credentialed live smoke uses a 24-hour discovery window while retaining
  its two-granule processing cap, so overnight UTC runs remain meaningful.
- dbt source assets now map to their ingestion asset keys, enforcing
  discovery, processing, then dbt order in the registered full-pipeline job.

### Removed

- Per-granule raw aggregates, legacy geography path/schedule variables, and
  unused `polars`, `tqdm`, `hypothesis`, `vcrpy`, and `pip-audit` dependencies

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Pinned production geography for countries, first-level regions, US counties,
  Canadian census subdivisions, and Mexican municipalities, including dominant
  IANA timezones and deterministic equal-area overlap weights
- Public `tempo_no2_grid_latest` mart on TEMPO's native 0.02° grid, with
  latest-only storage for supported-country cells
- Credential-free `make demo` warehouse and documented native DuckDB CSV and
  Parquet export recipes
- v0.1 to v0.2 derived-warehouse rebuild guide and production-geography live
  readiness mode

### Changed

- Warehouse and package schema version is now 0.2.0; populated v0.1 warehouses
  fail early with rebuild guidance
- Regional coverage and statistics use actual overlap area, country metrics use
  direct country pixels, and zero-valid regions remain visible
- Robust anomalies use seven prior analysis-ready observations at the same IANA
  local hour, with median and MAD scaling
- Regional aggregates, native-grid latest rows, and ledger success now commit
  atomically per granule

### Fixed

- Hourly ingestion now records every failed granule, fails the Dagster run after
  processing the batch, and retries failed rows with a clean download on the next run
- Dagster discovery honors `TEMPO_NO2_DISCOVERY_LOOKBACK_HOURS`, and hourly runs
  accept an optional `max_granules` limit
- `dbt/seeds/tempo_no2_contract.csv` is now the single runtime and dbt quality
  contract; inert threshold and backfill environment settings were removed
- `TEMPO_NO2_RAW_RETENTION_DAYS` now prunes only old, successfully processed
  NetCDF files while preserving their warehouse ledger history
- Manual discovery and one-granule live-readiness workflow with sanitized
  diagnostics and disposable local state
- Expanded operator runbooks for contracts, retention, backfills, and recovery
- Live Earthdata ingest: parse `earthaccess.DataGranule` metadata, persist HTTPS `download_url`, and download via authenticated `earthaccess.download`
- Real TEMPO L3 NRT NetCDF layout: read NO₂ and quality flags from the `product` group and 1D lat/lon grids
- Removed the approximate six-region bounding-box fallback; ingestion now
  requires validated v0.2 production overlap weights
- `.env` credential aliases: accept lowercase `earthdata_username` / `earthdata_password` in addition to `EARTHDATA_*`
